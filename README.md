# Excalidraw

![excalidraw-example](/diagrams/excalidraw.excalidraw.png)

[Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) is an open source drawing and diagramming tool this is in my opninon the easiest to get started drawing things and also [live collaboration](https://blog.excalidraw.com/building-excalidraw-p2p-collaboration-feature/) without the need for any email or signup process. 

## What I like

### Store .excalidraw as code

You can append `.png` onto the filename, e.g `diagram.excalidraw.png` and then that file can be versioned in GitHub to see history of changes.

You only need one file and can use one of the following methods to edit.

- On the web using [vscode.dev](https://github.dev/) with the [Excalidraw extenstion](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pomdtr.excalidraw-editor)

- Using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) with the [Excalidraw extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pomdtr.excalidraw-editor)

- Using the web version of [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) and opening the the cloned, or downloaded files
